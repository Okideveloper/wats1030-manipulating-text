I perfer Nano over the other text editor vi and emacs because it was much easier to navigate through the files. Editing and saving files
is important when using text editors so, nano was the best pick for my user-friendly mind.  With nano all I  had to do was enter
Ctrl o rather than emacs 2 command keys C-x C-s.
